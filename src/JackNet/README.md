# bronson - jacknet

---

This repo is a sub-repo for bronson containing the javascript for the jacknet file.

Jacknet will not work if it is not on a wired connection.
The purpose of this function is to quickly scan through buildings looking for devices and checking if it is online or if it is named correctly.
We currently do not have the ability to distinguish between the two.
