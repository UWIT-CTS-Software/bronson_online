# How to Change a Projector

---

Hello this is a test file used while building out the wiki functionality. These files has a secondary function to provide use cases. This file (test_file0.md) provies the scope and direction of the wiki file.

We will want to be able to display markdown files as well as provide the user with information about the files they are browsing. I want the header of the file to be displayed as File Title. This is because the header of the article will be a suitable name and the actual file name can be used for organizational purposes (Maybe).

When Wiki is opened we want a list of articles in the left hand side of the page with a sort of a 'start page' to be loaded when 'wiki' is selected. To start this file will be the target.
